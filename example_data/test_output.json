Second, if you\u2019re sick, rest, drink plenty of fluids, and stay warm.

I\u2019m not going to die, but I might get a little sick, and I\u2019m going to rest up and I\u2019m going to be back at it the next day.\nThe other thing is that you should be careful about what you read on the internet, and what you hear on TV or radio.
